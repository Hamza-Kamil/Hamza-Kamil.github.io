Accurate modeling of water infiltration and solute transport in unsaturated soils
is critical for various applications. These include optimizing irrigation practices to conserve water and minimize environmental impact, as well as predicting the fate of contaminants in soil and groundwater. This study explores the application of the vanilla physicsinformed neural network (PINN) approach for modeling the coupled system of water flow
and solute transport in unsaturated soils. We compare the performance of PINN with the
Galerkin finite element method (FEM) to evaluate their effectiveness. Various techniques
are implemented to improve the PINN solver, including adaptive activation functions. Numerical tests were carried out to evaluate the efficiency of the PINN solver in comparison
to the FEM. The findings reveal that PINN can achieve accuracy comparable to FEM,
albeit at a significantly higher computational cost during training, while maintaining fast
inference times.
