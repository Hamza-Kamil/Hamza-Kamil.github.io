I’m **Hamza Kamil**, a PhD candidate in a cotutelle program between École de Technologie Supérieure (Montréal, Canada) and Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (Ben Guerir, Morocco). My work sits at the intersection of applied mathematics and scientific machine learning, with two main thrusts:

1. **Physics-Informed Neural Networks** (PINNs) for modeling coupled multiphysics processes in real-world environments (e.g., surface–subsurface water and nutrient transport in soils).
2. **Theory of Scientific ML**, where I investigate the mathematical foundations and training dynamics of these algorithms to improve their efficiency and reliability.

I’m fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Azzeddine Soulaïmani](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Azzeddine-Soulaimani/) and Prof. [Abdelaziz Beljadid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_XAQf5YAAAAJ&hl=fr).
